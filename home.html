                Based in Portarlington, Co. Laois, TheGardenShop.ie was founded in 2011 with the principle of offering a wide range of garden products for the best value in Ireland. Together with our low-cost model & strong focus on customer service, our online garden shop quickly expanded in the Irish market.
            </p>
            <p>
                At TheGardenShop.ie, we have something for everyone, whether you are a beginner who wants to start out with a few small pots and trays on your windowsill, the 'green fingered' expert or professional landscape gardener, we have the tools for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                TheGardenShop.ie was set up with the aim of filling a massive gap in the garden supplies & tools market. To date, there are no other discount online garden centres where the public can go and get all their gardening equipment at massively discounted prices. There has been, to date a sort of unwritten rule on pricing and this is what TheGardenShop.ie aims to break. By this, we hope to give the whole gardening market in Ireland a huge & badly needed shake up.
